<p>Maxcoins transaction security has been upgraded with next-generation, Keccak SHA-3 algorithm for Proof of Work. 
Whilst SHA-2 was designed and developed closed-door by the NSA, Keccak was subject to an open competition with design and peer preview (NIST).</p>

<p>Keccak was also chosen as the official successor for SHA-256 after being a finalist and finally winning a 5 year long international competition run by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and as such chosen as the successor to SHA-256.</p>

<p>Special Note: Keccak is also much greener than SHA-256 and many other hashing functions, reducing cryptocurrencies ecological footprint.‚Äù</p>
