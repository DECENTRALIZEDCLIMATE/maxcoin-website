## Maxcoin Exchanges
---
As a community, we believe that when a cryptocurrency is allowed to grow organically thru effective management, planning and development rather than via marketers & financial means, it can stay true to itâ€™s decentralised principles and values. Therefore, Maxcoin does not pay for listings on exchanges and all the following listings are provided for free
